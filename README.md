This dataset is a summary of human activity measurements collected during normal activities.  The dataset was developed from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (HAR) from UCI.  The output of the project is a summary file titled HARSummary.csv. The project has developed the following files:

1. run_analysis.R -- the R script which downloads the original HAR dataset and creates the HARSummary.csv file.  The run_analysis.R script should be loaded into R or RStudio, and simply executed to produce the HARSummary.csv file.

2. CODEBOOK.md -- a description of the structure of the HARSummary dataset, the data elements in the HARSummary dataset, the process by which the dataset was developed from the original HAR data, and a brief description of how the original data was collected (in markdown format)

3. README.md -- this readme file (in markdown format)
